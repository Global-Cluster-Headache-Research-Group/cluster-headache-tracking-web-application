# Cluster Headache Tracker

Cluster headache tracker is an open source free application to track and analyze data for cluster headaches.

The application is in early stage of development. 

The goal of the project is to provide a platform where people with cluster headache track their attacks and used medications
in order to see what works best for them and what they should expect in the future.
The other major goal is to collect datasets for researchers. 
This data will be available to doctors and researches who is willing to research cluster headache and it's treatments.


## Current State
* A robust data storage was build.
* The development of a web application is in progress.


## Short term plans
In the nearest future our plan is to provide web  application that will allow to track attacks and used abortive and preventive medications.

The application will allow to track:
* Attacks: In order to investigate how number of pain free days between clusters depends on age, preventing treatment, weight, blood pressure, hormones, stress.

* Abortive treatments: In order to investigate  if a drug(or combination) may increase/decrease intensity, quantity or frequency of cluster attacks

* Preventive treatments: In order to investigate if a drug(or combination) may increase/decrease intensity, quantity or frequency of cluster attacks

* Height and Weight: In order to investigate if body mass index (BMI=m/h^2) affects attack strength 

* Age: In order to investigate if with age CH attacks get milder/stronger, consider menopause in women.

* Hormones: In order to investigate if hormone change can trigger or abort a cluster, or can be used to predict a cluster coming.

* Blood pressure: In order to investigate if low blood pressure can change intensity, quantity or frequency of cluster attacks


## Long term plans
Our long term plans is to analyze sleep patterns, including movement and heart rate in order to be able to be able to build a device that will be able to wake a person as soon as attack is coming in order to take abortive treatment.

For that will need to track:
* Sleep: In order to investigate if broken sleep pattern or lack of sleep can change intensity, quantity or frequency or frequency of cluster attacks, or that change in a sleep pattern can notify of a coming cluster. 
 
* Heart rate: In order to investigate if high heart rate during an attack can improves O2 consumption and thus faster abort an attack, or if heart rate changes during sleep can be used to notify a patient about coming attack. 

* Side effects: Investigate which short term and long side effects can be caused by various treatments on order to warn patients about possible consequences and risks.

## How YOU can help
* If you are willing to share your data with the community, please create a ticker and attach your data there with minimal description.
* If you are scientists and have ideas of what can be tracked and analyzed, share it with us via Feature request ticket.
* If you are willing to take part in development, join the project. We need:
  * A web developer familiar with React or Vue 
  * A Java Backend Developer familiar with Spring
  * A mobile application developer for iOS
  * A mobile application developer for Android 
  * A skilled SQL professional to build efficient queries on a given dataset. 
  * A ML specialist in order to build system able to predict coming attacks.
