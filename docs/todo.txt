Things to track:

Attacks
Investigate how number of pain free days between clusters depends on age, preventing treatment, weight, blood pressure, hormones 

Sleep  
Investigate if broken sleep pattern or lack of sleep can change intensity, quantity or frequency or frequency of cluster attacks.
Investigate that change in a sleep pattern can notify of a coming cluster.
Investigate if heart rate changes during sleep can be used to notify a patient about coming attack. 
 
Heart rate 
Investigate if high heart rate during an attack can improves O2 consumption and thus faster abort an attack.

Blood pressure 
Investigate if low blood pressure can change intensity, quantity or frequency or frequency of cluster attacks

Height and Weight
Investigate if body mass index (BMI=m/h^2) affects attack strength 

Age
Investigate if with age CH attacks get milder/stronger, consider menopause in women.

Abortive treatments
Investigate  if a drug(or combination) may increase/decrease intensity, quantity or frequency or frequency of cluster attacks

Preventive treatments
Investigate if a drug(or combination) may increase/decrease intensity, quantity or frequency or frequency of cluster attacks


Hormones
Investigate if hormone change can trigger a cluster, or can be used to predict a cluster.
Investigate if hormones can be used to abort a cluster.

Side effects
Investigate which short term and long side effects can be caused by various treatments on order to warn patients about possible consequences .
